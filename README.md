# xp

This repo contains some language experiments implemented in clojure
So much influences... fexprs, concatenative langs etc...
All comments are welcomed, i'm a selftaught programmer eager to learn where i'm wrong

## mud

A redo of clojure basic features with genericity and extensibility in mind
core.clj can be read as a code walk with exemples and comments along the code
the mud.boot package contains some low level utils that may be of interest (generic functions, minimal type system)

## fun

A dynamic object system, that aim to be as functionally pure as possible
It is slow but has a compelling syntax, also is very flexible and extensible

fn.clj defines functions introspection utilities
km.clj defines some nice API around maps with keyword keys (named keymaps)
